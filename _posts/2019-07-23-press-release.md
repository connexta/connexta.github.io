<em>Complementary talent and market leading solution offerings will strengthen capabilities and accelerate service delivery across defense, intelligence, and civilian government customers</em>

<p><strong>RESTON, Va. – July 23, 2019</strong> – Octo, a premier provider of next-generation services for the Federal market, today announced its acquisition of Connexta, a global leader in open source software development and secure discovery solutions for government and commercial customers. With this acquisition, Octo significantly bolsters its existing client base in the Intelligence Community (IC) and the Department of Defense (DoD), particularly the Air Force and its innovative software labs. The Connexta addition brings with it substantial capability expansion including open source and Agile software development, cloud engineering, data interoperability, geospatial, and C4ISR. The combination of the two firms establishes Octo as go-to experts in the data interoperability, API, and user interface arena for geospatial search and discovery solutions and combat systems. The capability enhancements realized through this acquisition make possible expedited delivery and data integration of combat systems across the armed forces, and also enhance Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR) tools for key customers in the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG). The acquisition of Connexta also significantly enhances Octo’s sensor integration capabilities, to include support for several of the nation’s “Five Eye” partners.</p>

<p>Connexta will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Octo and the integration will afford access to a broader set of U.S. Federal Government customers for Connexta’s solution offerings – including the Distributed Data Framework, a powerful geospatially-enabled search and integration platform, and Alliance, a system for enterprise ISR data sharing. These tools promote collaborative use of discovered data by analysts to produce enhanced ISR products. The integration of Octo and Connexta systems will unlock new levels of data sharing and analysis for agency leaders, and the combination of technical talent offers customers a deep and sophisticated team capable of taking on much larger and complex mission system modernization projects.</p>

<p>“This acquisition is a huge win for both firms. There are enormous synergies in our talent, culture, and solutions that will enable us to drive immediate value across our collective customer base,” said Mehul Sanghani, Chief Executive Officer of Octo. “Connexta’s two solution offerings lie at the heart of ISR integration and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) search and retrieval capabilities that are in use across many of the customers we presently serve in the DoD and IC, but also has been increasingly embraced by our allied partners. Perhaps equally as important, we’re both Agile and modern technology firms at our core with remarkably similar cultures. We’re adding a team that shares the same commitment to customer success that we do, and we’re only going to enhance these qualities as we integrate. We have preserved Octo’s culture through this acquisition, which is incredibly important to us for any acquisition we undertake.”</p>

<p>“Combining Connexta’s capabilities and services with Octo’s deep market knowledge will drive exponential value and impact for our combined customers,” said Andy Goodson, Chief Executive Officer at Connexta. “Our product offerings augment their services capabilities. Their broader customer base opens up new avenues for agencies to leverage our products. Additionally, we made it a priority for us and all our Connexta employees that we would place culture as a top priority in this process, just as Octo did. We knew very early on in the process that we had found a perfect match in Octo. We look forward to joining forces to provide more innovative, Agile solutions for both Octo’s and Connexta’s customers.”</p>

<p>Through this acquisition Octo adds roughly 130 personnel to its roster, primarily full-stack and cloud engineering resources. Octo now offers nearly 700 technologists to support and accelerate modernization efforts across its entire public sector customer base. Octo maintains a heavy presence in the DC Metropolitan area with offices in Reston, Alexandria, and Columbia, Maryland; and has presences in Richmond, Boston, Dayton, and St. Louis. The acquisition of Connexta adds offices in Boston, Denver, and Phoenix, and makes Octo a firm with international reach through contracts supporting strategic coalition partners in Europe, Asia, and Australia.</p>

<p>KippsDeSanto & Co. served as the exclusive financial advisor to Connexta during this transaction. </p>
